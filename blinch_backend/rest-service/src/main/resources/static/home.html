            Imagine colleagues you don’t work with on a daily basis want to get to know you, but don’t know if it’s appropriate to ask you to go for a lunch. Or you want to ask and feel akward.

            <p><h2>Inspiration</h2>
            Imagine during lunch you spread the word about a project you’re working on. Your colleague got a helpful link or connection that not only made your work easier, it inspired you to a whole new level.
